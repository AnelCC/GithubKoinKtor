what is dependency injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern where a class receives its dependencies (other classes or objects) from an external source rather than creating them itself.
By following the principles of DI, you lay the groundwork for good app architecture. Implementing dependency injection provides you with the following advantages:

- Reusability of code
- Ease of refactoring
- Ease of testing
